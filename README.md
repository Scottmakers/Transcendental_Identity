# Transcendental_Identity
A paper that outlines the governing dynamics, frameworks, and primative data types of Identity Mathematics

# Intro
Initial work on the Periodic Table of Information (PTI) was first conducted by Scott M. Akers, and Aaron Alan Alexander in Austin and Houston Texas in 2015.  It was an initial attempt at simplifying the information types, processes, and procedures that are inherent in blockchain systems.  Upon discovery of system, and with elucidation to the framework, it was discovered to be applicable to immutable and unique data/identity types in cyberspace with application to principals and calculations in physics, including Einstein's E=mc^2

The outcome of reseach culminated in the creation of Identity Mathematics: A semantic system for understanding digital identity, it's expression, and translation through dynamic hypermedia systems.

# Hypothesis
All identities exist in an event space, the event space occurs at a time interval (t=0), and the identity is at the intersection of 2 or more values.  

# Similar work
Ethereum's "state transition function" is a sufficient mechanism for securing arbitrary encrypted messages and recording their movement/influence in relation to the overall "state-of-the-state" EVM system.  PTI and Identity Mathematics differentiates from Ethereum's function by establishing additional deterministic information types that are atomic, seperable, and representative of Identity information that exist within a system.

# Simplistic?
Absolutely.  Blockchain technology is only the first evolution of a cybernetic organism that is accessible, available, and human-meaningful for People, Content, Machines, and Corporations at a global scale.
