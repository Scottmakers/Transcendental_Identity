# Transcendental_Identity
A paper that outlines the governing dynamics, frameworks, and primative data types of Identity Mathematics.

# Intro
Initial work on the Periodic Table of Information (PTI) was first conducted by Scott M. Akers, and Aaron Alan Alexander in Austin and Houston Texas in 2015.  It was an initial attempt at simplifying the information types, processes, and procedures that are inherent in blockchain systems.  Upon discovery of system, and with elucidation to the framework, it was discovered to be applicable to immutable and unique data/identity types in cyberspace with application to principals and calculations in physics, including Einstein's E=mc^2.

The outcome of research culminated in the creation of Identity Mathematics: A semantic system for digital identity, it's expression, and translation through dynamic hypermedia systems.

# Hypothesis
All identities exist in an event space, the event space occurs at a time interval (t=0), and the identity is at the intersection of 2 or more values.  

# Similar work
Ethereum's "state transition function" is a sufficient mechanism for securing arbitrary encrypted messages and recording their movement/influence in relation to the overall "state-of-the-state" EVM system.  PTI and Identity Mathematics differentiates from Ethereum's function by establishing deterministic information types that are atomic in nature, seperable from a particular system of expression, and provide enough nuance to differentiate between Identities at both a granular and universal level.

# Simplistic?
Absolutely.  Blockchain technology is the first evolution of a cybernetic organism that is accessible, available, and human-meaningful for People, Content, Machines, and Corporations at a global scale. The goal of this work is to help refactor the information that exists in cyberspace, allowing the creation of further frameworks and identity types that belong in the realm of Identity Mathematics.

Bandwagoneers and ICO hucksters are a plague.  May you forever fall short of God's glory forever.
